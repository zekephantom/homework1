Update Log

1. I had trouble figuring out how to randomize
colors on Java in Android Studio. Some StackOverflow websites
seemed to not help, especially that they use float
variables.

2. Inheriting classes seemed to be a lapse in my memory
as I forgot how to do them. Luckily, there's a video on YouTube
which helped me refresh my memory.

3. I had trouble implementing the Path method in Android
Studio, so I went to https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path.
